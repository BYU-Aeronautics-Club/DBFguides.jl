There are some variable parameters for most payloads–-these are covered later.\nWing size: There is usually a maximum wing span length.  Since the mission requirements are sensitive to weight, teams usually try to maximize their wing span to allow for more carrying capacity, but don't be too hasty, an optimial design might not maximize carrying capactiy.\nTake-off distance:  Sometimes there will be a requirement to take off in a particlular distance, or from some sort of launch pad/ramp.\nMinimum Flight Time: There is typically a set of missions that require a specific number of laps, this means that the aircraft must have at least that much endurance and speed. There is usually a mission without any payload mass, and one with payload mass.\nGround Mission: There is usually some sort of ground mission involving some sort of assembly or configuration of the aircraft, usually within a specific time window. (This is scored relative to the fastest time of all competitors, but is not directly affected by first principles, so is likely not included in the sensitivity study.)\nSafety: There are always safety requirements, usually in the form of a arm/disarm button, but there may be other requirements as well.\nBattery Capacity: Depending the the battery type (LiPo), there may be a upper limit to total and individual battery size, usually in the form of watt-hour capacity. (Read the rules carefully here, there were a lot of battery rule additions in 2020.)\nStructural safety: Usually some safety test of the structure is required, something like a simulation of a 2.5g load case (wing tip test).\nMisc:  There may be some miscellaneous requirements like folding wings, or transported size or some other convenience requirement. There are also other safety requirements that do not affect the sensitivity study, but are important to avoid disqualification.","category":"page"},{"location":"how-to/sensitivity/#Objectives","page":"General Sensitivity","title":"Objectives","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"how-to/sensitivity/","page":"General Sensitivity","title":"General Sensitivity","text":"When we come to mission objectives that are senstive to design parameters:","category":"page"},{"location":"how-to/sensitivity/","page":"General Sensitivity","title":"General Sensitivity","text":"Payload Mass:  There is typically an increase in points for a given increase of mass.
