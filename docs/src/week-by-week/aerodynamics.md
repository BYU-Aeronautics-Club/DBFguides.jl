# Aerodynamics


The 31-week project breakdown could be as follows:

| Week | Tasks |
|------|-------|
|-2 | Help with recruiting|
|1| 1)Read the Rules. 2) Compile list of sub-system requirements for the aerodyanmics system. |
|2| 1) Organize your sub-team. Get a team leader, and figure out who is on the aerodynamics sub-team.  Pass around contact info, or get on the slack channel for the aerodynamics team, etc. 2) Brainstorm ideas for the aerodynamic concepts (wing/wings configuration, tail configuration, wing/body integration style, etc.). |
|3| 1) Put together decision matricies concering the aerodyanmic concept design.  What are the wing configuration options?  Tail configurations?  Other aerodynamic concepts? 2) Get the new/unitiated members familiar with the hand calcs you're going to use for your initial sizing and rough conceptual design.|
|4| 1) Do some quick hand calculations in order to get a glider that will actually glide, and from which you can gain some physical intuition about how your calculations relate to reality.  You don't need it to carry a ton of weight or do anything but glide at this point.  But perhaps you should at least try to get a really good glider simply as is at this point.|
|5| 1) Build a glider from your conceptual design.  This includes hot-wiring a wing. |
|6| 1) Glide your glider and learn something from the experience.  Also take a video and show your friends to get some hype going for the team.|
|7| 1) If you haven't already, have teach the new/uninitiated members learn the tools they'll need for the preliminary design. 2) Make a plan (and write it down) for the trade studies you need to do for the preliminary design.|
|8| 1) Take your conceptual design and throw it in a VLM analysis (XFLR5 or other VLM code). 2) Start working with any other tools you need for your trade studies. |
|9| 1) Continue with trade studies.  Write things down as you go.|
|10| 1) Continue with trade studies.  Write things down as you go.|
|11| 1) Finish trade studies.|
|12| 1) Begin your preliminary prototype.  This should be a powered, controlled airplane that can complete the first flight mission, and maybe the second.|
|13| 1) Continue building your prototype. |
|14| 1) Fly your prototype.  Get some data for the performance characteristics of the plane at this point. |
|15| 1) Do some more flight tests. Try and actually do the first, and maybe second, missions.|
|16| Christmas Break. |
|17| New Year Break. If you're feeling ambitious, start on some CFD if needed. |
|18| 1) If needed, start on some CFD. 2) Begin nailing down the absolute final details of your design based on the results of your flight test. |
|19| 1) Finish final analyses if applicable. 2) Start construction of what you can for the final testing prototype.|
|20| 1) Finish manufacturing|
|21| 1) Do final flight testing.  Should be able to do all 3 flight missions at this point. This prototype should be fully integrated with other teams as well, so the ground mission should be doable too.|
|22| 1) Support any final writing needs for the Design Report. |
|23| 1) Begin final manufacture of the competition aircraft. |
|24| 1) Continue building competition aircraft.|
|25| 1) Continue building competition aircraft.|
|26| 1) Continue building competition aircraft.|
|27| 1) Finish construction of competition aircraft.|
|28| 1) Do full dry runs of the competition, complete with timings etc. So you know exactly what to expect on competition day. (note that altitude in Tucson, AZ is half of what it is in Provo)|
|29| 1) Don't crash/break anything.|
|30| 1) Make any final adjustments. |
|31| 1) Compete. 2) Win.|
