# Leadership

We assume here that team leadership includes primarily the Engineering Lead and Project Manager, but also the sub-team leads. Sub-team leads should focus on their respective suggested schedules, but be aware of the overall milestones discussed here as well.

The Engineering Lead should obviously oversee the engineering tasks for the most part, and the Project Manager should focus on the logistics, such as writing, budget, etc.  They should work together, however, and not shy away from helping each other.

The 31-week project breakdown could be as follows:

|Week Number|Tasks|
|:----------|:----|
|-2 | Head up recruiting |
| **Phase I:** | **Conceptual Design ---  Weeks 1-7 --- Goal: Concept Design Done and Proposoal Submitted** |
|1| 1) Read the Rules.  2) Update proposal and report templates' formatting according to any rule changes.  3) Begin compiling checklist.|
|2| 1) Write the Mission Requirements Decomposition section of the Proposal AND of the Design Report. 2) Organize the team members into sub-teams, elect or assign team leads, etc. 3) Write the Team Organization subsection of the Proposal AND of the Design Report. |
|3| 1) Lead team discussion on brainstormed concept ideas. 2) Help teams in their efforts to assemble decision matricies for the conceptual design phase.|
|4| 1) Lead team meeting for finalization of design concepts, making sure everything can fit together in a single design. 2) Get the decision matrices from the individual teams and put them in the Concept Weighting and Selection Process subsection of the Design Report. 3) Write up the Schedule subsection of the Proposal. 4) Facilitate concept prototyping among all the teams. |
|5| 1) Lead team meeting to finalize the major design concepts and resolve any conflicts before moving on in the design.  2) With input from the manufacturing team, write the Manufacturing Plan section of the Proposal, and the Manufacuring Processes Investigated and Selection Process Results subsection of the Design Report.  3) Write up the Testing Plan section of the Proposal and the Test and Flight Checklists subsection of the Design Report.|
|6| 1) Write up the Sensitivity Study subsection of the Proposal AND Design Report. 2) Write up the Budget subsection of the Proposal 3) Write the Executive Summary section of the Proposal. 4) Send out Proposal for advisor review.|
|7| 1) Revise/Edit the Proposal after getting feedback. 2) Submit the Proposal. 3) Write up the portions of the Completed Testing subsection of the Design Report related to the conceptual testing that was completed. |
|_Notes:_ |_By this point, you have submitted the Proposal, but you should also have the Management Summary and Conceptual Design sections of the Design Report completed as well.  You should also have the manufacturing process selection section finished in the Design Report, and the Test and Flight Checklists subsection of the Design Report done.  If you don't have all of these done at this point, you should make sure to do them ASAP._|
|**Phase II:**|**Preliminary Design --- Weeks 8-17**|
|8| 1) Place a hard stop on conceptual designing. At this point, the concepts are set. 2) Initiate the preliminary design phase with the team, indicating appropriate tools for the various sub-teams. 3) Facilitate the beginning of trade studies for the various sub-systems. 4) Write an outline for the Methodology subsection in the Preliminary Design section of the Design Report.|
|9| 1) Continue facilitating trade studies within the various teams. 2) Write up parts of the Methodology subsection you outlined earlier. |
|10| 1) Encourage preliminary prototyping as is possible (some teams may not be ready yet). 2) Finish up the Methodology subsection of the Design Report.|
|11| 1) Write up any trade studies that are complete at this point. 2) Continue to facilitate any other trade studies that are lagging. 3) Push for preliminary prototyping from all teams. 4) Help teams that are ready perform preliminary testing. |
|12| 1) Continue as in week 11 |
|13| 1) Continue as in week 11. 2) Finish writing up the Trade Studies subsection of the Design Report. |
|14| 1) Facilitate testing. Everyone should be testing by this point. 2) Write up the Estimated Aircraft Performance subsection of the Design Report. 3) Write up the portions of the Completed Testing subsection of the Design Report that are able to be written at this point.|
|15| 1) Make sure every team has done their final preliminary testing by the end of this week.  2) Make sure a preliminary, powered, controlled, flight test is done by the end of this week. 3) Finish writing the portions of the Completed Testing subsection of the Design Report associated with the preliminary testing. |
|16| Christmas Break |
|17| New Year Break |
|_Notes:_|_By this point, you should be done with preliminary design and testing and be just about ready to build your final testing prototype.  This prototype should be complete enough that you can test the entire set of missions.  You may also want to do some final, high-fidelity analyses if your testing hasn't progressed far enough for some subsystems, and to maybe grab a few extra points on the Design Report._|
|**Phase III:**| **Detailed Design --- Weeks 18-23 --- Goal: Fully Operational Prototype and Design Report Submitted**|
|18| 1) Decide if there is any higher fidelity analyses that need to be done (CFD, FEA, etc.) and have the teams initiate those. 2) Begin manufacturing of a fully operational prototype, starting with the components who don't require high fidelity analyses. 3) Begin to write up the Detail Design section of the Design Report. |
|19| 1) Continue any final analyses. 2) Continue manufacturing. 3) Begin final testing. 4) Continue to write up the Detail Design section of the Design Report. |
|20| 1) Finish final analyses. 2) Finish up manufacturing. 3) Continue final testing. 4) Continue writing up Detail Design section of the Design Report. |
|21| 1) Do the final testing.  2) Write up the rest of the Completed Testing and Planned Testing subsections of the Design Report. |
|22| 1) Write the Executive Summary of the Design Report. 2) Add in final drawings package to Design Report. 3) Write up the Performance Results section of the Design Report. 4) Send report off for advisor review. |
|23| 1) Apply advisor feedback and finish up the Design Report. 2) Submit Design Report.|
|**Phase IV:**|**Final Manufacturing and Dry Runs --- Weeks 24-30**|
|24| 1) Manufacture the final aircraft. 2) Finalize travel plans and reservations.|
|25| 1) Continue as in week 24.|
|26| 1) Continue as in week 24.|
|27| 1) Continue as in week 24.|
|28| 1) If you haven't already, do full dry run(s) of ground and flight missions. 2) record proof of flight. |
