# DBF Guides

Within the Aeronautics Clubs we currently have one official team: The AIAA Design Build Fly Team that associated with the annual [AIAA Design Build Fly Competion](https://www.aiaa.org/dbf).  The team github can be found at [github.com/BYU-Aeronautics-Club/DBF](https://github.com/BYU-Aeronautics-Club/DBF).

For the team's quick reference, we have started to compile various tips, tricks, and helpful hints available here.  Note that these pages are very much works in progress.  Some of the contents are our best guesses at best practices/things to try in the future.  As the team gains experience, members will add, subtract, and adjust content.  If you have any suggestions for improvements, reach out to the club leadership.
